# Predicting-Hospital-Readmission-using-NLP
In this project, I build a machine learning model to predict 30-day unplanned hospital re-admission using clinical notes.

# Getting Started
To run the Jupyter Notebook, you will need to get access to the MIMIC-III database, a freely available hospital database.
Due to the sensitive nature of medical data, I cannot include the data openly in this repository. If you'd like to get access to the data for this project, you will need to request access at this link: https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/

You will need to download the `ADMISSIONS` and `NOTEEVENTS` tables into this project's folder.

# Blog
I wrote a full blog post for this project as well: https://medium.com/nwamaka-imasogie/predicting-hospital-readmission-using-nlp-5f0fe6f1a705
